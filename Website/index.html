      <h3 class="light-text">History:</h3>
      <p>
        The National Council for Prescription Drug Programs, was founded in 1977 as a non-profit organization dedicated
        to standardizing electronic data interchange for pharmacy-related transactions. Initially, the organization
        focused on the development of a standardized format for electronic billing of prescription drugs, but over time,
        its scope expanded to include other areas of pharmacy operations.

        In the 1980s and 1990s, NCPDP played a key role in the development and adoption of electronic prescribing
        standards, which enabled healthcare providers to electronically transmit prescriptions to pharmacies. This
        helped to reduce errors and improve patient safety, as well as streamline pharmacy operations.

        In the early 2000s, NCPDP worked on the development of a standard for medication history, which allowed
        healthcare providers to access a patient's complete medication history electronically. This standard helped to
        reduce the risk of adverse drug events and improved patient outcomes.

        Today, NCPDP continues to develop and promote standards for electronic pharmacy-related transactions, as well as
        provide education and resources to its members and the healthcare industry at large. Its standards are
        recognized and used throughout the healthcare industry, and NCPDP remains committed to improving patient safety
        and interoperability in the pharmacy industry.
